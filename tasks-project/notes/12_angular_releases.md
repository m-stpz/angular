## 3. The Angular Renaissance (2022-26)

- Starting with v14, Angular started to be "reimagined" to compete with more modern, lightweight frameworks like React and SolidJS

| Version | Release date | Key features                                                                                                         |
| ------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| V14/15  | 2022         | Standalone components. The death of mandatory `NgModule`. This made Angular easier to learn and reduced boilerplate. |
