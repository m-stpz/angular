## NestJS and Angular

### 1. Modules as the main organizational unit

- Both put together and expose building blocks
  - Group features (AuthModel/UsersModule)
  - Control imports/exports
  - Encapsulate domain boundaries

### 2. Depency Injection everywhere

- Both frameworks use DI as the core pattern
  - Constructor injection
  - Providers registered in modules
  - Scopes (singleton, request-scoped)
